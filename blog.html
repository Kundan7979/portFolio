                <p>1.3 <strong>Evolution of the cluster</strong>-Jaitu area is known for the best staple of cotton. Most of the area is covered under sandy soil followed by clayey soil except some patches where there is appreciable thickness of top clay
                    layer varying from 6.7 to 16.7m. This area is known for cotton cultivation but with the constant inclement weather, excessive and untimely rains followed by humid conditions, the farmers have been compelled to switch over to paddy
                    cultivation since 1995, as cotton crop has been attacked severally by American boll worms and has not providing the required returns. However to retain the previous cultivation of cotton, the farmers are being persuaded for cotton
                    cultivation using BT seed. Faridkot district lies in Malwa belt of the Punjab and it was known as the Cotton belt of Punjab but now due to the high usage chemical fertilizers and pesticides, it has become the Cancer belt of Punjab
                    with highest number of health issues to human and environment. Kheti Virasat Mission has been promoting the organic farming in the area for the last 15 years. With its constant and selfless efforts, a number of farmers have started
                    doing organic farming and move towards multi-cropping. Hence, breaking the monoculture of wheat and rice. In the 30 villages of Jaitu block, 3000 women have been growing organic seasonal vegetables through organic kitchen gardens.
                    These women are conserving the native seeds and doing the food processing of the surplus produce. These women are potential in providing the nutritional and health security at the household level. These very women are involved in TRINJAN
                    initiative of Kheti Virasat Mission that is the “Revival of Traditional Skills through Rural Livelihoods”. </p>
                <br>
                <p>1.4 <strong>Demography and Growth Trend</strong>- According to Census 2011 information, Jaitu has a population of 1, 60,930 peoples. There are 30,981 houses in the sub-district. Rural households are 23,751 and urban households are 7230.
                    Rural males constitute 65,027 and rural females constitute 58,526 of the total population. Urban males are 19,880 and urban females are 17,497 of the total population. Total males and females population is 84,907 and 76,023 respectively.
                    As of the 2001 India census, Jaitu had a population of 33,465. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Jaitu has an average literacy rate of 62%, lesser than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 67%, and female

                <br>
                <p>1.5 <strong>Socio-EconomicAspects</strong> -Jaitu's main economy is agriculture. It is known for its mandis which is the local word for market, they are famous for wheat and paddy trade. There are different processing industrial units.
                    There are around 30 rice mills and 3 cotton factories. There are some timber saw mills also. People are not continuing anymore in the traditional occupations due to the lack of raw material’s availability and no demand as cheap products
                    are available in the market. Traditional skills are spinning, weaving, embroidery, carpentry, blacksmithery and others. People specially the youngsters are migrating to abroad for jobs and career as they think there is no opportunity
                    in Punjab. Agriculture has become the least preferred work and choice. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A study, carried out amongst mentally retarded children in the Malwa region of Punjab, revealed 87% of children below 12 years and 82% beyond that age having uranium levels high enough to cause diseases. Unscientific farming practices,
                    that emerged after the introduction of Green Revolution, are also alleged to be a reason for growing incidence of not just cancer but also, high rates of spontaneous abortions, reproductive aliments, genetic deformities, anaemia, diarrhoea,
                    vomiting, fluorosis and a host of skin ailments including rashes and boils.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A 2007 epidemiological study found that the surface waters of Malwa region are contaminated with arsenic, cadmium, chromium, selenium and mercury primarily due to the discharge of untreated waste water from surrounding industries. With
                    increasing poisoning of the soil, the region once hailed as the home to the Green revolution, now due to excessive use of chemical fertilizer, is being termed the "Other Bhopal", and "even credit-takers of the Revolution have begun
                    to admit they had been wrong, now that they see wastelands and lives lost to farmer suicides in this 'granary of India.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>1.6 Human Development Aspects</strong> - During the post-independence period, Punjab witnessed a high level of economic prosperity. The Green and the White Revolutions ushered in economic growth as seen from high per capita incomes.
                    High levels of economic development gave Punjab a relatively high HDI. Punjab has an HDI value of 0.537. Only Kerala has a higher value of 0.638.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, the high levels of development did not translate into progress for women. Society remained feudal and women’s development abysmal resulting in a low gender development index.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1.7 <strong> Key Economic Activities in the Region-</strong> Agriculture and animal husbandry are the main source of livelihood in this area. The primary sector includes agriculture and related activities. Apart from this, people are involved
                    in personal business and government jobs too. These days youngsters are migrating to abroad for getting the employment.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1.8 <strong>
                    Infrastructure: Social, Physical, Financial and Production related-
                </strong> In the area, there are women who are willing to work and want some sitting work that can be done from the house itself. For this they have the basic infrastructure needed e.g. the spinning wheel, handloom, crochet, knitting needles,
                    darri loom etc. These women need initial financial support in order to get new equipments and tools that have got old as they have been using it since long time. After seeing the elder women working, young generation is also getting
                    interested to do the hand based work.</p>

                        <p> Field of desi/native short staple cotton is low as compare to the commercial cotton. Farmers look for a premium price as the cotton is fully organic without any chemical fertilizer and chemicaYl pesticide .It needs extra care and

                <br>
                <p>Synthetic clothing and synthetic colors have a lot of health hazards and cause environmental destruction. Chemical dyes are a big cause of polluting rivers and water bodies. Bt cotton and other synthetic fabric cause skin diseases, cancer,
                    pigmentation, irritation and a lot more problems due to the use of chemicals in its processing. Gradually, along with organic food, the demand for organic clothing and natural dyes is also increasing. People want a socially and ecologically
                    responsible products where a fair wage is given to one’s hard work and it’s in harmony with nature too. TRINJAN products are high in demand among the people who are associated with the organic farming movement in the country. For other
                    common people it becomes a little expensive as a number of people are involved in the processes and all the work is done manually. Each of the artisan associated is paid with dignity. So far demand is higher than the production. A
                    lot of awareness programs are done in rural and urban areas of Punjab, it includes cultural festivals, folklores, literary workshops, singing, folk dance, poems etc. We are doing offline marketing as of now, online marketing has to
                    be developed for making a larger outreach of these artistic products. </p>

                <p>In the present scenario with regard to Punjab’s agriculture and environment, Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM) began its awareness- and discourse-building work from 2005 onwards. Various aspects related to intensive agriculture paradigm were
                    discussed in repeated dialogues with farmers and other stakeholders including doctors, consumers, civil society groups, students, business people, government officials etc. Through its tireless work, Kheti Virasat Mission has created
                    a debate and discourse on alternative paths to agricultural development amongst farmers, consumers, academics and the government. It has also led to many farmers successfully shifting to organic farming in this heartland of the Green
                    Revolution. In 2015, KVM had celebrated its 10 year-long journey towards achieving the “Evergreen Revolution” and this proposal is also in connection to this noteworthy development. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>KVM is committed to provide people with safe and healthy food with environmental security. A lot of efforts have been made to understand and revive the traditional practices of agriculture and water conservation. Primarily, KVM started
                    working with the farming community and tried to address the various problems faced by today's agricultural system. Gradually, KVM as an organization and a part of bigger social movement (organic farming movement) have attempted to
                    look at other issue in the society as well.</p>

                <h1>KVM’s Interventions</h1>
                <br>
                <p>KVM has pooled successful master organic farmers from across India and initiated a series of workshops in different parts of Punjab, to bring confidence in Punjabi farmers around ecological farming, and to build their capacities. To substantiate
                    the argument of farming without pesticides and to give scientific reasoning to the strength of organic farming, KVM also roped-in known agriculture scientists to address the farmers. Opportunity was provided to the farmers to visit
                    organic farms in different parts of India as exposure trips so that it helps in better visualization and can serve as a source of motivation to begin with the organic farming. In the last 15 years, KVM has undertaken multi-dimensional
                    approach to engage with the concerned strata of society and build awareness through series of public dialogues, seminars, conferences, workshops and food and cultural festivals on broader issues of Sustainable Agriculture, Environmental
                    health (particularly the health impacts of intensive agriculture), Water and Ecological Crisis, issues related to food security, seed diversity and food safety. </p>

                </ul>
                <p>As by now it’s well known that Green Revolution has done more harm than good to the soil and people of Punjab by promoting the monoculture model of chemical farming. During its 15 years of existence, KVM has organized more than 1000 of
                    Workshops, Seminars, Organic Farming Training Camps, village level meetings and more than 500 Farmer Field Schools covering more than 24,000 farmers across all the districts of Punjab. KVM has undertaken several field studies and campaigns
                    to build a social movement around ecology, health, toxicity, safe food and sustainable agriculture. This covers a vast arena of field visits to the problem areas and mass education. A lot of farmers are associated with KVM who have
                    been doing organic farming successfully and keep sharing their experiences with other fellow farmers. It has also led to many farmers successfully shifting to organic farming in this heartland of the Green Revolution. As of now KVM
                    has around 2500+ dedicated Organic Farmers associated with it in addition to urban activists including scientists, students and women. Apart from local resources and knowledge, KVM has invited farmers, scientists and experts of organic
                    farming from different parts of the country. Some of the names are Dr. Debal Deb from Orissa who has saved more than 1,300 varieties of native rice from the tribal belt of the state that was about to vanish, Subhash Sharma, a progressive
                    organic farmers from Yavatmal district of Maharashtra, Suresh Desai from Belgaum, Karnataka who is a sugar cane expert and shared his experience with the Punjab’s farmers. Vijay Jhardhari from “Beej BacahaoAndolan”, Uttarakhand has
                    also visited us several times. ManbirReddu from Haryana has conducted many workshops on insect literacy.</p>

                <p>While working with the male farmers, a need to work with the women farmers was realized as they are important stakeholders in the agriculture. Before Green Revolution women would work equally with the men in the fields, but these 3-4 decades
                    of chemical intensive and market based farming did not allow women much to be part of the farming community. Women do take care of the household and when they got to know about being serving poisonous food to their children, they became
                    so unhappy about it. A group called “Women’s Action for Ecology” was established. Under this initiative, a large number of organic kitchen gardens were started in Barnala and Faridkot districts of Punjab. Till date in both these districts
                    there are about 6000 kitchen gardens in 60 villages. Women along with providing safe and nutritional seasonal vegetables to their family are also able to save monthly income. After fulfilling the household needs they do sell some of
                    the vegetables in the village itself that gives them an extra source of income. These women are also multiplying seeds to disseminate among women with a theme – “Grow Safe Food and Feed your Children with Safe Food”. This activity
                    is also contributing in making these women self-dependent in vegetables and greens. This saves their money, ensures health and brings back the tradition of self-reliant villages to some extent.  </p>

                <p>As awareness about safe and healthy food increases among the community, consumers demand the organic food. In order to provide consumers with the chemical free food and make a direct link between the producers and consumers, Kudarati Kisan
                    Haats have been set up in various cities of the state that run on daily and weekly basis. A number of value added products like pickles, jams and snacks, vegetables, pulses and cereals are sold here. At present these ‘KudaratiKisaanHaats’
                    are providing marketing avenues to appox. 200 farmers from the districts of Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawansahar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Sangrur, Barnala, Moga, Muktsar, Fazilka, Ferozepur, Faridkot, Bathinda, Patiala
                    and Fatehgarh Sahib. Volume of such marketing has crossed Rs 9, 00,000 per month on an average basis. Some of the raw products are further processed and packed by these farmers and supporting informal groups of KVM for the marketing
                    of Organic products. The Haat is established in the cities namely: Patiala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Kotkapura, Muktsar, Barnala, Chandigarh, Bhatinda and some semi regular markets in the form of Kudrat Huts in Gurdaspur, Muktsar, Jaitu
                    etc. We are also establishing Permanent stores namely Kudrat Huts since the consumers are demanding regular supply of the organic produce. Currently we have Kudrat Hut in Bhatinda and Muktsar. </p>

                    Forum has so for organized a number of Kavi-Darbars on plight of farmers, environmental crisis and GM Food. A book of Punjabi poems ‘Maff Karin Pani Pitta’ (Dear father water please forgive us) was edited and compiled and published

                <p>To reintroduce agro-biodiversity and millet based healthy foods in to kitchen KVM has started working on millets. KVM is persuading farmers to sow millets, though in small areas for self-consumption. It is a kind of re-invention of earlier
                    cropping systems in Punjab where Jowar and Bajra were cultivated for the consumption of the family. Seeds of pearl millet were made available to farmers who asked for the seeds. KVM has successfully organized 12 traditional food festivals
                    in Punjab. In the times of climate change, millets are the promising crop for both human and environmental health.</p>

                <p>As the part of women action for ecology this campaign was launched. ‘Feed your children with poison free safe food’ is the slogan of this campaign so it begins with making kitchens poison-free means free from food stuff which is grown
                    with pesticides and other agro-chemicals. Women were motivated to start small kitchen gardens to grow seasonal vegetables organically and use that only. This initiative is also ensuring more diverse and safe food for new generation
                    of Punjab. Started from Chaina and Bhotna two villages this campaign is now slowly picking-up across the state. Another dimension of this campaign is conservation of native diversity of vegetable seeds. In the era of IPRs it is important
                    to have own seeds in our hands.</p>

                <p>Seeds are vital in agriculture without which it just can’t be done. Now in the era of rapid marketization and company based farming, native seeds have been going away from farmers and hybrid seeds are being provided to the farmers. KVM
                    has been promoting the farmers to save their own native seeds using traditional methods and farmers keep exchanging these seeds of freedom with each other in order to achieve the “Seed Sovereignty”. Seeds from different parts of the
                    country like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh etc. have also been collected and multiplied. Farmers have set up their own seed banks with different varieties. Women doing kitchen gardening have also saved
                    the seeds and have more than 30 varieties of seeds of different vegetables Initially, KVM have established its first formal Seed Bank in village Chaina of district Faridkot and next it happened in village Bhotna of district Barnala
                    within upcoming days. KVM has motivated a lot of farmers of the state to regain their indigenous seeds for a sustainable and independent livelihood. This initiative is leading a large number of farmers to conserve seeds of hope for
                    the wellbeing of all.</p>

                    actions are being taken. TRINJAN was very prominent social unit which stood for liberty, wisdom, self-expression and self-empowerment among women. As an economic measure, TRINJAN served as a common facility for production of handmade
                    products. For the young of the village, it was an important institution for skill learning and value education. Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM) has made a start in Faridkot to revive this women driven tradition while linking it to current
                    concerns of environmental degradation. The use of organic desi cotton is emphasised in the TRINJAN workshops thereby also promoting the breaking the monoculture of rice/ wheat. The TRINJAN model now aims to extend itself as a viable
                    socio-economic alternative for Institution Building for grass-root efforts to revive the village crafts in an increasingly patriarchal, decontextualized and deskilled Punjabi society.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>TRINJAN: Building the Social Fabric with Compassionate Warp and Dedicated Weft</strong>TRINJAN is the symbol of caring and sharing in Punjabi community. Under this umbrella, women used to spin, weave, knit, sing, celebrate, appreciate
                    and create different kinds of artistic products. It used to be a platform of collective teaching and learning with a close association of nature and culture. The type of development model which is being adopted in last 5-6 decades
                    didn’t allow women to enhance the collective working and its spread to the next generation. Younger generation is getting school and college education where these traditional creative skills are not considered worthy. That’s why the
                    spinning wheel which is a symbol of life is being burnt by people in chullah as fuel wood. Same has happened with the handlooms and other material used for handicrafts and textile items. With this background and zeal to prevent this
                    great traditional art from being vanished, KVM started working for its revival. For us, these are not mere products that come out, there is a connect of human and nature that can be clearly seen along with the association and owness.
                    In order to preserve this heritage, Organic Desi Cotton is being grown by the farmers, procured by KVM, hand spun, naturally dyed and hand woven by the rural artisans. Along with this there are artisans who do hand embroidery, crochet,
                    Knitting, make different grass crafts and other decorative products. All these skills have been promoted and developed under TRINJAN. It has freedom for the artisans as they can work from home, most of the artisans are women. It’s
                    a very good opportunity for the livelihood generation and pass on this skill to the next generation. KVM believes that revival of traditional, slow, natural and cultural wisdom shall help addressing the physical, mental and emotional
                    health crisis that people have been going through. These are socially and ecologically responsible products</p>
